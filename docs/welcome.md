Welcome to richWorld!

This **whole** website started out as just [d2Docs](../d2docs), a place for my friends and I to have our own guides and walkthrough's for a game called Destiny. It soon became the biggest part of richWorld, *rich*Docs, is named so because we offer *rich* documentation. Anything from advanced number theory, walkthroughs on taking down tough bosses, to basic programming.
