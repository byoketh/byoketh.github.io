# Kalli, the Corrupted

## Plates

In the middle of the room there will be three pairs of symbols hanging from the ceiling. Around the room, there are similar symbols hanging above metal plates. Each member of the fireteam should find a plate who's symbol matches one in the middle, and stand next to it until everyone has found a plate.

Once the encounter starts, 2/3 of the plate will become taken (glowing white/black), then explode. While staying on the plate, you will need to stand on the 1/3 of the plate that isn't taken, if you are on a taken section when it explodes, you die. After you have been on your plate for enough explosions, a knight will spawn. Upon slaying this knight, the symbol above your plate will disappear, as well as it's matching one in the middle of the room, and you can head to the middle of the room to dps Kalli.

- Sometimes Kalli will come pay you a visit at your plate, but a few shots will send her on her way

## Doors

As mentioned before, each plate matches one of the symbols in the middle. Each pair of symbols actually unlocks the doors under them, one symbol being one row each. It is always a good idea to do as many plates as you can. However, if you have a full fireteam you need to do all of the plates so 6 doors open on each side.

## DPS

For dps, the fireteam is usually positioned in the middle of the pit in the very center of the room. This pit is split into thirds, with groups of doors in each third. *Kalli* will appear over one of these groups of doors immediately damagable; after a bit of time, she will raise her hands and begin chanting, shortly after this, some of the doors below her will open. You will need to find an empty door to get into before Kalli wipes the room with a blinding light. Only one person can survive in each door if two gaurdians manage to squeeze into one, they both die.

- My fireteam usually looks at the social menu, number ourselves 1-6, and go into the doors accordingly. this way, it isn't a total free for all

After the doors open back up, you can head back out and start dpsing again. Once all three groups of doors have been used however, Kalli will become immune to all damage, and your team will need to head back to plates, rinse and repeat untill she is vulnerable again.
