# oracles

## oracle spawns

oracles are blue glowing boxes that will spawn around the room in seven locations seen [here](img/oracle.png). the first set will contain three oracles and each wave will add one more until the final wave of with seven.

## preview

the spawn order and postions of the oracles will be shown twice. a chime will be played every time an oracle is shown to help guardians count the spawns. guardians should call out when ever they see an oracle spawn by calling out the number in the the sequence that the oracle takes. after the order is shown twice all current oracles will spawn at the same time and they can be broken

## breaking oracles

once the oracles have been spawned in guardians must shoot them in the order displayed in the preview. when a guadian breaks an oracle a messege will appear in the bottom left of the screen confirming so, though the guardian should stil call out that they have done so.

## failing the sequence

if a guardian shoots breaks an oracle in the wrong order or if all oracles are not broken fast enough, all guardians will get the marked for negation debuff and must cleanse in the pool in the middle of the room.

## the only oracle for you

to complete the "the only oracle for you" challenge each guardian can only break each specific oracle once. this means that all guardians must participate in breaking the oracles. when completing the challenge on master all guardians are guaranteed the "praedyth's revenge (timelost)" sniper rifle.
