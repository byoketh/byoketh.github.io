# templar

## ageis relic

the "aegis relic" commonly refered to as 'the shield' or "the relic" will spawn in the middle of the room in the cleansing pool, picking it up will start the encounter. the relic has four functions: light melee attacks, a dash attack which is replaced by a slam while airborne, a block which creates a bubble around the user shielding guardians inside from all incoming damage, and a super which launches and explosive projectile. the super can be used to break the shield of the templar. if the relic is dropped and is not picked up quick enough it will despawn killing the entire fireteam

## oracles

oracles will spawn during occasionally which fucntion as they did in the previous encounter except they will only spawn in sets of three.

## dps

once the relic holder has broken the templar's shield all guardians will be able to damage it. damage is usually done from the ledge to the left of where the rally banner it placed or on the stairs behind the banner.

## teleports

during the dps phase the boss will attempt to teleport around the room to restore it's shield. these teleports are indicated by blue or red rings with a blue light shooting up from them. if a guardian is standing in the ring when the boss attempts to teleport then the boss will be blocked and stay in place. blocking the teleports is usually the job of the relic holder.

## detainment

occasionally a guardian will be detained causing them to be trapped in a bubble unable to shoot or move, the only way to free a detained guardian is for other guardians to do enough damage to the bubble. if a guardian is detained for fifteen seconds without being freed they will die.

## cheese

a common strategy used in this encounter is that all guardians except the relic holder will jump off of the map before the encounter is started. all guardians will then respawn once the relics have detonated and the relic holder will use the cleanse pool to remove the "marked for negation" debuff before breaking the templar's shield. this allows the guardians to ignore the first set of oracles and if they kill the templar fast enough they they can ignore all oracles.

## out of its way

to complete the "out of its way" challenge guardians must not let the templar teleport a single time. when completing the challenge on master all guardians are guaranteed the " fatebringer (timelost)" hand cannon.
