# confluxes

## defense

the main objective of this encounter is to defend three confluxes against waves of goblins, hobgoblins, fanatic, minotaurs, and wyverns(chickens). the confluxes are on the left, middle, and right of the room. if an enemy reaches the conflux is will kneel down infront of it and the conflux will turn red, after a few seconds the enemy will sacrifice itself to the conflux. if four enemies sacrifice to a single conflux then the fireteam will wipe, if one wyven sacrifices then it is an immediate wipe. overload minotaurs will spawn occasionally.

## marked for negation

when a fanatic is killed it will drop a white puddle of radiolarian fluid. if a guardian touches the puddle they wil recieve the "marked for negation" debuff. Occasianlly the templar will send out a pulse called the "ritual of negation", this will kill all guardians who have the marked for negation debuff. to cure the mark of negation guardians must walk through a glowing pool in the center of the room. the pool has a cooldown between when it can be used so all guardians needing a cleanse should enter at the same time.

## wait for it... 

to complete the "wait for it" challenge guardians must kill the wyverns as they are sacrificing to the confluxes. it is recommended that the guardians get the wyverns to at least half health before it begins to sacrifice to guarantee that they can kill it in time. hen completing the challenge on master all guardians are guaranteed the "visions of confluence (timelost)" scout rifle
