# Prologue

to begin this raid, the fireteam will fight a reflection of savathûn; once it is defeated the gates will open, allowing passage deeper into the swamp.

once past the gate, gaurdians may transmat their sparrows and ride to the knowledge kart™ 

## Knowledge

once at the knowledge kart, gaurdians will begin to accrue stacks of a debuff *prevading darkness* the closer to x10 this gets, the harder it will be to see. at x10 the debuff kills. to cleanse this debuff, gaurdians must stand next to the knowledge kart.

*knowledge bearers* will also spawn. killing these will spawn 3 *apogee repeaters* and collecting these will give a buff, depending on how many are picked up; note only 3 may be held at a time. to bank their knowledge, gaurdians stand next to the knowledge kart.

- 1 - heightened knowledge
- 2 - brimming knowledge
- 3 - overflowing knowledge

when all 3 *knowledge bearers* are slain, gaurdians will no longer recieve *prevading darkness*

when all 9 *apogee repeaters* are banked, the kart will move closer to the ziggurat.

repeat this process 6 times and the knowledge kart will unlock the enterance to the ziggurat.

:::tip secret chest #1
gaurdians must shoot three darkness spikes hidden along the path toward the ziggurat: 
- to immediate the left of the knowledge kart at your second stop, nestled against a rock wall, beside a fallen tree 
- behind the building all the way at the end of the path flanked with columns at the third stop, around the corner to the left (or to the far right of the area where the knowledge bearers spawn, but around the corner behind you)
- under the bridge at the fourth stop, which you can access through a hole on the side opposite where the knowledge kart stops.

## Deepsight chest

after the fireteam enters the ziggurat, before the big drop down, a totem will appear with three glyphs. these glyphs represent a specific room, gaurdians need to activate the glyphs at the back of the rooms that match the ones shown on the totem.
