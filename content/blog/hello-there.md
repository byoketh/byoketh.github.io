Hey there! I'm Richie, I'm an aspiring developer constantly diving into creative projects. This blog is where I'll be sharing my journey, from the initial ideas, to the projects I'm building along the way.

My fascination with technology has existed since I can remember. When I learned that my school Chromebook ran on "ChromeOS" which was really just something called "Linux", I found my 7th grade self falling head-first into learning basic shell so I could use ChromeOS's cli at the time, crosh.

One of the first projects I'm really proud of is AthCal. It's a small Python script I authored my junior year of highschool for scraping athletic events from a website and populating them to a Google Calendar. Through creating this project, I learned invauluable skills like data manipulation, working with APIs, and finding documentation. You can check out the code for that now archived project over on my GitHub page here: https://github.com/byoketh. I'm always looking to connect with fellow developers and dreamers to exchange ideas and collaborate on new projects. Reach out and let me know what you're working on!

In future posts, I plan to delve deeper into my current projects and future ideas, share tutorials on content I'm learning, and even explore some more philosophical aspects.

Thanks for reading,

Richie â™¥
