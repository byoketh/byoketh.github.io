This blog is where I&#39;ll be sharing my journey, from the initial ideas, to the projects I&#39;m building along the way.</p>\n<p>My fascination with technology has existed since I can remember. When I learned that my school Chromebook ran on &quot;ChromeOS&quot; which was really just something called &quot;Linux&quot;, I found my 7th grade self falling head-first into learning basic shell so I could use ChromeOS&#39;s cli at the time, crosh.</p>\n<p>One of the first projects I&#39;m really proud of is AthCal. It&#39;s a small Python script I authored my junior year of highschool for scraping athletic events from a website and populating them to a Google Calendar. Through creating this project, I learned invauluable skills like data manipulation, working with APIs, and finding documentation. You can check out the code for that now archived project over on my GitHub page here: <a href=\"https://github.com/byoketh\">https://github.com/byoketh</a>. I&#39;m always looking to connect with fellow developers and dreamers to exchange ideas and collaborate on new projects. Reach out and let me know what you&#39;re working on!</p>\n<p>In future posts, I plan to delve deeper into my current projects and future ideas, share tutorials on content I&#39;m learning, and even explore some more philosophical aspects.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading,</p>\n<p>Richie â™¥</p>"
